# SwiftUI-Academy

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the SwiftUI Workshop Program!
Here, you'll find instructions for completing the challenge.

## The Challenge

The purpose of the challenge is for you to demonstrate your SwitfUI skills. This is your chance to show off everything you've learned during the course!!

You will build and deliver a whole SwiftUI application on your own. We don't want to limit you by providing some fill-in-the-blanks exercises, but instead request you to build it from scratch.
We hope you find this exercise challenging and engaging.

The goal is to build an application that will use the SwiftUI capabilities which must include:

- A Book List Screen
- A Book Details Screen
- A Shop Cart Screen

## Requirements

These are the main requirements we will evaluate:

- Use all that you've learned in the course:
  - Best practices
  - UI design
  - Design patterns
  - Testing

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Create your repo and project
1. Make your project private
1. Grant your mentor access to the project
1. Commit periodically
1. Apply changes according to the mentor's comments
1. Have fun!

## Deliverables

We provide the delivery dates so you can plan accordingly; please take this challenge seriously and try to make progress constantly.

It’s worth mentioning that you’ll ONLY get feedback from the review team for your first deliverable, so you will have a chance to fix or improve the code based on our suggestions.

For the final deliverable, we will provide some feedback, but there is no extra review date. If you are struggling with something, contact your mentor and peers to get help on time. Feel free to use the slack channel available.

## First Deliverable (Pending...)

Based on the self-study material and mentorship covered until this deliverable, we suggest you perform the following:
  
- Search fo images that represent the books and add the image in the assets folder.
- Work with MVVM in order to design the application.
  - Create a screen that will show the Book List
  - Create a detail screen that will show the book title, author, descripction, image, category tags and price.
- Use best practices

> Note: what’s listed in this deliverable is just for guidance and to help you distribute your workload; you can deliver more or fewer items if necessary. However, if you deliver fewer items at this point, you have to cover the remaining tasks in the next deliverable.

## Second Deliverable (Pending...)

Based on the self-study material and mentorship covered until this deliverable, we suggest you perform the following:

- Add persistence in order to use the application when the user is offline.
- Create a screen that will show the Cart with the items added to be purcahse in the future.
- Add some unit tests and ui tests.
- Do UI refactor.
- Use best practices.

> Note: what’s listed in this deliverable is just for guidance and to help you distribute your workload; you can deliver more or fewer items if necessary. However, if you deliver fewer items at this point, you have to cover the remaining tasks in the next deliverable.

## Final Deliverable (Pending...)

- Add awesome animations using all the capabilities that SwiftUI provides like "rotationEffect" or "scaleEffect" and try using different animation timing curves like "easeOut" or "spring".

> Important: this is the final deliverable, so all the requirements must be included. We will give you feedback and you will have 3 days more to apply changes. On the third day, we will stop receiving changes at 11:00 am.

## Submitting the deliverables

For submitting your work, you should follow these steps:

1. Share your commit changes with your mentor.
2. Stay tune for feedback
3. Do the changes according to your mentor's comments
